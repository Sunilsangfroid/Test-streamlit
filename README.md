# **Autonomous Agents with Heurist.ai**

This is the project for **FrostHack 2025**. We’re building **autonomous AI agents** using the **Heurist Agent Framework**, and our agents need to be capable of a few core tasks, like processing natural language, generating images, and handling voice interactions, all across platforms like **Telegram**, **Discord**, or **Twitter**.

## What We’re Building

We’re creating agents that can:
- **Deploy on platforms**: Make your agent work on Telegram, Discord, or Twitter.
- **Process natural language**: Use large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate human language.
- **Generate images**: Use AI models to create high-quality images.
- **Handle voice**: Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.

### The Only Rule:
You *must* use the **Heurist Agent Framework** to build everything. Other than that, it’s up to you how you choose to approach the problem. 

## Getting Started

Here’s how to get up and running:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/frosthack-2025.git
   cd frosthack-2025
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Heurist.ai**:
   Follow the Heurist setup guide here: [Heurist Setup](https://heurist.ai/setup).

## File Structure

Here’s a quick look at the basic file structure to help you navigate:

```
frosthack-2025/
├── agent/                # Your autonomous agent code and logic
│   ├── agent.py          # Main agent logic
│   ├── nlp.py            # Natural language processing functions
│   ├── image_gen.py      # Image generation logic
│   ├── voice.py          # Voice interaction functions
├── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies for the project
├── run_simulation.py     # Script to run the agent in the simulation
├── heurist_config.yaml   # Configuration for Heurist.ai setup
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── .gitignore            # Git ignore settings
```

### Key Files:
- **`agent/`**: This is where you’ll write your agent’s logic and functionalities for NLP, image generation, voice interactions, etc.
- **`run_simulation.py`**: The script to test your agent in a simulation environment.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains all the dependencies your project needs.

## Running the Agent

Once everything is set up, you can test your agent by running:

```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

This will launch the environment and start your agent.
